    "description": "Letting your application know what's around you is hard. aGPS can be deceiving and work poorly indoors and the context of user is even more difficult to determine. With BLE beacons such as Eddystone, we can make our applications smarter. In this talk, I explore what exactly beacons are, how we can use them to hint and progressively enhance our users experience.",

This lets you focus on creating extraordinary user experiences instead of building a back end. </br></br>In this code lab a team of Google Developer Advocates will guide you through the process of building a chat application using Firebase and Android Studio. </br></br>This talk is an introduction to Firebase, but it assumes that you're already comfortable writing simple Android apps. Please come with Android Studio installed and your Android device ready to go.",

    "description": "How to build web sites that work well across various browsers versions and devices is always challenging for web developers. In the session, youâ€™ll learn the best practices and strategy to develop cross-browser web sites that will work with the existing and future browsers. Tools for interoperability tests, cross-browser fundamentals, and tips and tricks on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript development will be illustrated.  Feature detection, CSS prefix, and fallbacks will all be examined in the session. A real life example will be used to demonstrate step by step how to build cross-browser and plug-in-Free experiences. With a couple of simple changes to your sites, you can take advantage of web standards and HTML5 features today without breaking your sites in the future. Expect a lot of demos and code in the session.",

However, that's now changing with the emergence of cloud products like Dataflow. Pablo will jump into this brand new product from Google, and show how it let's you focus on your code, rather than worrying about the infrastructure needed to work with big data. He'll talk about how you can use it to clean, and analyze your data with ease, and how Dataflow will spin up & tear down VM clusters for your data pipelines on the fly!",

    "description": "Managing infrastructure, worrying about scalability, and waiting for queries to finish executing are some of the biggest challenges when working with massive volumes of data. One solution is to outsource the heavy lifting to someone else, thereby allowing you to spend more time on actually analyzing, and drawing insights out of your data. Google want to be that someone else! Part of their big data product lineup, BigQuery is a bleeding edge SaaS that is designed to make it easy for users to get up and running without the need to care about operational overheads. In this presentation, Graham will give an introduction to BigQuery, and show how it can be used to query terabytes and billions of rows in ridiculously fast times. He'll cover its core features, cost model, available APIs, and caveats. Finally, he'll show how they used BigQuery at a recent project for Australia's largest ISP, and give a quick demo of BigQuery in action.",
